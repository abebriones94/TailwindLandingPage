# TailwindLandingPage
Setting up Tailwind CLI and creating a landing page. I will be teaching myself the many common utility classes of Tailwind 

Coding along with Brad from Travery Media has taught me a great deal of basic Tailwind uses and its classes. For me, it provides a much more cleaner, straight forward visualization of how the syntax directly correlates with the design of the web app. For example, below is a container class that holds two items...

"container flex flex-col-reverse items-center px-6 mx-auto mt-10 space-y-0 md:space-y-0 md:flex-row"

Having multiple classes within the container styling and their position in the line allow for a more cohesive mental layout of the page that is being styled.
